AbstractXXX 

## Succesful crosses

- The frequency of hybrid production by each cross is recorded in the table [Raw_frequency\\_crosses](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/phenotyping/Raw_frequency_crosses.csv "Raw_frequency_crosses"). The data is used in Figure 3A

## Parent genome contribution

- The compressed file [winAvgDepth](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/sppIDer/winAvgDepth.rar "winAvgDepth") contains the individual files of the coverage values for each hybrid used to generate Figures 4A, 4B, and 6B
- The compressed file [nuclear_sppIDerDepthPlot](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/sppIDer/nuclear_sppIDerDepthPlot.rar "nuclear_sppIDerDepthPlot") contains the individual files plotting coverage across nuclear genomes of reference strains. Plots are generated by [sppIDer](http://bit.ly/2NacaXQ "sppIDer") and used in Supplementary Figure 3
- The compressed file [mito_sppIDerDepthPlot](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/sppIDer/mito_sppIDerDepthPlot.rar "mito_sppIDerDepthPlot") contains the individual files plotting coverage across mitochondrial genomes of references strains. Plots are generated by sppIDer and used in Supplementary Figure 4

## Chromosomal aberrations and chromosome composition

- The table [number_aberrations](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/sppIDer/number_aberrations.csv "number_aberrations") describes the chromosome losses, gains and aberrations inferred from sppIDer plots. The data is used in Figure 2A and 6A
- The compressed file Chromosome_composition contains the tables with the chromosome composition by species and the total number of chromosomes for each hybrid. The data was inferred from the sppIDer plots. Data was used for generating Figures 2B and 6C

##Cell size and ploidy
- Raw images taken from the microscope used to calculate the cell size are compressed in the [Cell_size\\_raw\\_images](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/phenotyping/Cell_size_raw_images.tar.gz "Cell_size_raw_images") file
- The estimated cell area for each strains is described in table [Cell_size\\_estimations](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/phenotyping/Cell_size_estimations.csv "Cell_size_estimations"). The data is used in Figure 3B.
- Ploidy estimations based on flow cytometry are described in table [Flow_cytometry\\_ploidy\\_estimations](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/phenotyping/Flow_cytometry_ploidy_estimations.csv "Flow_cytometry_ploidy_estimations"). The data is used in Supplementary Figures 5A, 5B, 5C.

## Growth kinetic parameters
- Optical density measurements at 600nm are compressed in [Optical_density\\_measurements](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/phenotyping/Optical_density_measurements.rar "Optical_density_measurements").Date_growthcurve.csv contains the measurements and Date_growthcurve_layout.csv has information about the strain and media contained in each well.

## Cassette coverage distribution
- Coverage values for the chromosome IV extracted from sppIDer outputs and coverage values calculated using [HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper "HybPiper repository") were described in the compressed files [ChrCovWindow](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/hybpiper/ChrCovWindow.rar "ChrCovWindow") and [CassetteCov](https://github.com/PerisD/SynHybrids/blob/master/hybpiper/CassetteCov.rar "CassetteCov"), respectively. The data is used in Supplementary Figure 7B.
